# Bro, you got Issues

Based off initial client-side-only [Github Auth code by Vjeux](http://blog.vjeux.com/2012/javascript/github-oauth-login-browser-side.html)

Almost entirely client-side, except for the proxying to an external server to store the client_secret.

## todos
* error handling on the JSONs

## classes
* body
  * .auth-none, .auth-known
